    <p>For millions of years, dinosaurs reigned supreme during the prehistoric period, roaming the Earth with their impressive size and diversity. Giant herbivores like Stegosaurus grazed on vegetation, while fearsome predators like Tyrannosaurus Rex hunted prey. These mighty reptiles thrived in a wide range of habitats, from lush forests to arid deserts. However, their fascinating reign was ultimately cut short by a catastrophic asteroid impact, leaving behind fossils as a testament to their once dominant presence on our planet.</p>

Known for its sail-like structure on its back, it likely inhabited both land and water, suggesting a semi-aquatic lifestyle. With a long crocodile-like snout, it primarily fed on fish. Fossils indicate it had robust forelimbs, possibly adapted for swimming. Discovered in North Africa, Spinosaurus remains have sparked debates and ongoing research regarding its anatomy, behavior, and ecological niche.</p>
